		<h2>About Us</h2>
		<div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<p>The purpose of this website is to display the most popular articles that have been published by major news outlets across the United States on companies that the user subscribes to. If you would like to follow a particular company but you do not want to go through the hassle of browsing through various news outlets, then this is the place for you. We plan to add additional features to the webpage at a later stage. One of which will notify users when new articles are published if the user adds any contact information.</p>

		<h2>How It Works</h2>
		<div>
			<div class="subSection">
				<p>To get started, the user should go to the edit subscriptions page. On that page, the user can add additional information to his/her profile. We will not store any of the user data inside our database. We will instead store the data inside the device that the user is using. The profile data can therefore only be accessed using the same device and browser that was used to add the information. The webpage allows you to add multiple users and companies to one profile. Adding contact information is not mandatory. However, contact information does need to be associated with a contact name. It can therefore only be added if a contact name is added too. Once data is added to the profile, it cannot be modified. It should instead be removed and re-added. The user can view all profile information on the user information page, and he/she can be directed to the latest articles by clicking on any news box within the company articles page.</p>
